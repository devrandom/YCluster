- do not use "feat: " and other such prefixes in commit messages
- we use `docker compose` (not `docker-compose`)
- all operations are performed using docker compose commands (e.g. ansible)
- there is no need to load the ansible inventory file, it's loaded by default
- initial bootstrap is from an admin laptop of the s1 core node (autoinstall and ansible playbooks).  docker compose is used.
- further bootstrap is from s1 to s2, s3 (autoinstall and ansible).  no docker is involved here.
