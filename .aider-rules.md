- to rename a file use `git mv`, do not emit the file contents
- when asked to update a document, such as `ARCHITECTURE.md`, do the following:
  - get the repo history since the doc was last updated with:
```sh
    git log -P --stat `git log -1 --format="%H" -- ARCHITECTURE.md`
```
  - request any files you need to see if the commit comments are not enough for updating the doc
  - update the doc, following the general convention (e.g. verbosity) in the doc
